Last sunday I went to [Museum Angkut][1], a transportation-themed museum in Kota Batu, with my family.
While Museum Angkut is fascinating, I found this little oddity in its sister museum, [D'Topeng Kingdom][2].
This carving is said to be an 100-year-old calendar found in East Java.
However, I noticed that most of the characters on the calendar look very much like Korean alphabet, [Hangul][3].
It remains to be seen if this carving is legit and if Korea has any relationship with Java in its early days.
