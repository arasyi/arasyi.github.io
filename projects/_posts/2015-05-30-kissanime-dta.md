I love anime. And there's no better place to watch anime than [KissAnime][1]. But if you're like me who likes to download all the episodes for future use, it's a bit inconvenient to manually open each episode link, choose the quality, and save it with the correct name to a folder. Hence, I created this small script that hopefully can help: 

[KissAnime-DTA][2]

KissAnime-DTA is a userscript that lets you display download links for all episodes on KissAnime so you can use [DownThemAll!][3] or similar tools to download them.

Since this is a userscript, you will need [Greasemonkey][4] or similar stuff to install it in your browser.
Up until this moment, I have only tested it using Firefox and DownThemAll!. 
However, it should work as well in Chrome provided that you have the correct tools to automatically download the links.

Find out more about this script on the project homepage here: [KissAnime-DTA][2].
