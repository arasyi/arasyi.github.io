Hi there,  
Welcome to my blog!

Looks like I haven't seen you before.  
Either this is the first time you visited this site, or you used different browsers back then.

Before letting you in, I need to make sure that you understand and agree to the terms and conditions of this site.

### This is my blog

This site contains my personal notes and opinions on things I found interesting and useful.
It is intended for personal use, but you are free to read and share it if you like.
Just make sure to give proper attribution.

### I am free to write what I want

If you don't like what I write, or you simply hate me, *[the door is wide open][1]*.

### I am human

*I am human, therefore I make mistakes.*  
Please remind me using the provided comment and contact forms if you find any mistakes that I make.

*I am human, therefore I may change.*  
I always strive to be consistent.
However, old things may no longer be relevant, or I may simply have a change of heart.
If you find anything inconsistent, again feel free to use the comment and contact forms.

### You and you alone are responsible for what you do 

If this site inspires you to do something good, that's great.  
However, as the guys in xda-developers forum often say (adapted),
> I am not responsible for ruined life, broken relationship, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because of you spending time on this site.  
> Please do some research if you have any concerns about the content of this site.  
> YOU are choosing to read this site, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your life, I will laugh at you.
